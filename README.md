Hello! I am a Full Stack Developer with experience in the most popular technologies on the market. If you ask me, what can I do as a developer? I will answer you: practically everything! I'm like a magician who can build apps from scratch and take them to the next level. âœ¨ My superpower is the ability to work on both the Front End and the Back End. I can create attractive and functional user interfaces using technologies such as JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML and CSS. I love working with these languages because they allow me to create interactive and dynamic web pages that surprise users. As for the Back End, I take care of everything that happens behind the screen. I use NodeJS, Express, and databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB to build robust and scalable servers that ensure high application availability. I like working with these languages because they allow me to create a solid and organized structure that ensures the stability of the application. In addition, I also use Typescript, a language that allows me to write more readable and maintainable code. Thanks to this, I can make sure that my code is well structured and well documented. As a Full Stack Developer, I am able to build apps from scratch, implement new features, fix issues, improve performance, and most importantly ensure a great user experience. I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest technologies. In short, I am a passionate developer, committed and always willing to learn new things. I love working in a team, sharing my knowledge and helping others improve their programming skills. If you need a Full Stack Developer, I'm here to help you! ðŸ˜Š

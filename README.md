✨ Hi there! I'm a Full Stack Developer with a bunch of tools.
If you need someone to work with databases, I'm familiar with MySQL, PhpMyAdmin, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. 

On the server-side, I'm comfortable working with Express and Node.js. Additionally, I've worked with various frameworks such as Next.js, Angular, and WordPress. 

If you need object-oriented development, I can also work with TypeScript. When it comes to the user interface, I've worked with React and Redux, and have a great understanding of CSS, Javascript, and HTML. 


In summary... I'm ready to work on any project you need, so let's talk!
